## Known Bugs

_The webpage has to be refreshed before submitting the form a second time._

_Created a space for user to enter their name, but haven't quite figured out how to append this value to the div shown at the end, as the input comes through a separate form. There are also some issues with the gradient background at large viewport sizes.
